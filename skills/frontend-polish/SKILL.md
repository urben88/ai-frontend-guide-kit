description: "Use when the user asks to polish, refine, QA or do a final visual review of frontend UI (\"pulir\", \"polish\", \"revisión final\", \"QA visual\", \"dejar impecable\", \"revisar el diseño\", \"dar el último pase\"). Runs the total polish loop: audits with the external design skills when installed (impeccable, taste-skill, emilkowalski), an interactive pass with Playwright MCP over states, console, accessibility, keyboard and reduced motion, exact fixes, and a closing @playwright/test regression. Works with fallbacks when those tools are missing."

# Frontend Polish — total finish pass

Phase 3 of the `ai-frontend-guide-kit` workflow. Goal: a screen that survives scrutiny — correct business flow, deliberate craft, nothing generic, no console noise.

## When to use

- "Pulir", "polish", "revisión final", "QA visual", "dejar impecable", "last pass" on a screen or block.
- After composition (phase 2) or after any small change (see `10-ITERATE.md`).
- **NOT for**: changing flows or restructuring screens — that is the UX phase (`02-UX-FLOWS.md`); polish never redesigns silently.

## Step 0 — Scope and context (always)

1. Ask/confirm the scope: which screen, route or block; which states matter. One screen per pass.
2. Read the existing artifacts, do not re-explore the repo: `ai-frontend-output/ux/EXPERIENCE-BRIEF.md`, `ai-frontend-output/ux/UX-SPEC.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `PRODUCT.md`, and the `06-REUSE` decision log if present.
3. Look at what changed: `git status` + `git diff --stat` (polish what moved, not the whole app).
4. Declare the plan in one line: screen + states + tools available.

## Step 1 — External audits (only if installed)

Skills are opt-in by their own descriptions; load them when present, never assume slash commands:

- **`impeccable`** (if installed): run its `audit` workflow on the screen, then its `polish` workflow. Treat its findings as the primary craft checklist.
- **`design-taste-frontend`** / taste-skill (if installed): hierarchy, density and proportion review.
- **emilkowalski** (if installed): `review-animations` (or `improve-animations`) when the screen has motion; `emil-design-eng` for interaction physics.
- If none are installed, use the distilled checklist in `guides/08-PHILOSOPHY.md` (anti-generic rules, springs, effect budget).

Record every accepted finding with its fix; do not apply an external suggestion that contradicts `PRODUCT.md`, tokens or the license rules.

## Step 2 — Playwright MCP pass (the loop)

If Playwright MCP is configured, verify the browser once (`npx playwright install chromium`), start the dev server, then iterate:

1. **Navigate** to the screen and take an accessibility `snapshot` — it is the ground truth for roles, names and focus order.
2. **Console**: read console messages; any error/warning is a finding.
3. **States**: capture and review each state that carries intent — default, hover, focus-visible, active/pressed, loading, empty, error, disabled, success. Screenshot before/after every fix.
4. **Keyboard**: traverse the screen with Tab/Shift+Tab/Enter/Escape; focus must be visible, ordered and trapped only where it should be (modals).
5. **Reduced motion**: emulate `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`; animations must degrade to no-motion or opacity-only.
6. **Responsive**: resize to the project's breakpoints (e.g. 375 / 768 / 1280 / 1536); check layout collapse, overflow and touch targets (≥ 44px).
7. **Content**: text hierarchy (max 3 sizes), contrast (body ≥ 4.5:1, large ≥ 3:1), spacing from the scale, no boxes-inside-boxes.
8. **Automated a11y and performance**: run the axe and Lighthouse checks from `guides/09-VERIFY.md` (sections 4–5) and the honesty audit (section 6) for conversion flows.
9. **Fix exactly what was reported**, then re-run the affected checks. No finding is closed without a re-check.

Report each iteration with evidence: state + screenshot + what changed. Keep a running findings list (optionally `ai-frontend-output/polish-report.md`).

## Step 3 — Regression gate

Close with `guides/09-VERIFY.md`:

- `npx playwright test` — critical funnel E2E + visual snapshots for the polished states.
- Red test = not done; fix the exact reported issue and re-run the full suite.

## Step 4 — Close

- Checklist from `09-VERIFY.md` (reduced motion, keyboard, console, licenses) is green.
- Effect budget respected: max 1–2 high-impact effects per view; effects do not compete.
- If the pass changed a component decision (replaced/adapted a catalog entry), record it: `node ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/memory.mjs add --screen ... --block ... --need "..." --decision reuse|adapt|build [--id <entry-id>]`.
- Summarize: findings found, fixes applied, checks run, anything deliberately left open.

## Fallback without tools

- No Playwright MCP → use the `@playwright/test` suite from guide 09 plus the self-review checklist of `08-PHILOSOPHY.md`; state clearly which interactive checks could not be run.
- No external skills → apply the distilled rules of `08-PHILOSOPHY.md`.
- Never block the pass on missing tools; never claim a check that was not executed.

## Rules

- One screen per pass; keep reads token-thin (never load the whole catalog).
- Polish does not change UX flows, copy strategy or component choice beyond what the audit justifies.
- Licenses stay intact for reused components (no stripping notices).
- If a finding implies a UX change, stop and hand it to the UX phase with user consent.
