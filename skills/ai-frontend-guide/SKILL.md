description: Reuse-first UI workflow for frontend projects. Use when designing or building any UI/UX (pages, sections, components, forms, animations, landing pages, dashboards) in a project that contains the ai-frontend-guide-kit folder. Decide the experience direction first (adaptive questions guided by the local Laya engine), consult the local component catalog before writing custom code, follow the guided flow in three on-demand phases (experience + UX/theory, composition, total polish), and optionally rank candidates with Laya after asking the user once per session. Covers interactive reference discovery (example sites with the user, likes and screenshots, component combinations), catalog discovery, reuse/adapt/build decisions, installation, licensing, playbook for small changes/custom additions, the Excalidraw UX map and verification with Playwright MCP.

# AI Frontend Guide

Reusable-first UI workflow for AI agents. The point: **search what already exists before creating anything from scratch** — and **choose the experience direction before choosing visuals**.

## What you have

When this kit is installed, the project contains:

- `ai-frontend-guide-kit/AGENTS.md` — awareness layer (read this first).
- `ai-frontend-guide-kit/guides/00…10` — the guided workflow (router + direction + three phases + iteration).
- `ai-frontend-guide-kit/experience/` — direction knowledge: `EXPERIENCE-DIRECTION.md`, `QUESTION-BANK.md`, `SITE-ARCHETYPES.md`, `UX-PHILOSOPHIES.md`, `STYLE-DIRECTIONS.md`, `REFERENCE-PROTOCOL.md`, `DISCOVERY-LOOP.md`, `experience-manifest.json` and `references/` (saved idea cards).
- `ai-frontend-guide-kit/catalog/` — 4,287 reusable entries from 34 verified sources (licenses, install commands, links), plus a light index.
- `ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/` — `find.mjs`, `get.mjs`, `laya_select.py` and `excalidraw-mcp.mjs` (local, dependency-free Excalidraw MCP).
- Sibling skills (when installed): `frontend-polish` (total polish phase), `ux-map` (visual screen map) and the three external design skills (`impeccable`, `design-taste-frontend`, `emilkowalski`).

If the folder is missing, install it with:

```bash
npx github:urben88/ai-frontend-guide-kit
```

## Route first (intake)

Ask the user what they want before touching code and declare the route: new frontend (phases 1→2→3), direction only (`01-EXPERIENCE-DIRECTION.md`), small change or custom addition (`10-ITERATE.md`), polish only (phase 3), UX only (`02-UX-FLOWS.md`). The phases are entry points, not a fixed pipeline.

## Start here

1. Read `ai-frontend-guide-kit/AGENTS.md`.
2. Follow the phase that matches the route — read **only the guide for the current phase/step**:

| Phase | Guide | Output |
|---|---|---|
| 0 · Intake | `00-START-HERE.md` | route declared + phase map |
| 1 · UX & theory | `01-EXPERIENCE-DIRECTION.md` | `EXPERIENCE-BRIEF.md` (archetype, philosophy, journey, IA, 3 directions, visual brief) |
| 1 · UX & theory | `02-UX-FLOWS.md`, `03-TOKENS.md` | context + `PRODUCT.md` + `UX-SPEC.md` + `flow-report.html` + `ux-map.excalidraw` + `DESIGN.md` |
| 2 · Composition | `04-INVENTORY.md` … `07-ADAPT.md` | inventory, shortlist, reuse/adapt/build + install, adapted components |
| 3 · Total polish | `frontend-polish` skill + `08-PHILOSOPHY.md`, `09-VERIFY.md` | audits + Playwright MCP loop + E2E/visual checks green |
| Iterate | `10-ITERATE.md` | small changes and custom additions |

## Experience direction first (guide 01)

For a new frontend or redesign, run the direction phase before any UI:

- Adaptive questions in rounds of 3–5 from `experience/QUESTION-BANK.md`; never ask what the repo/PRD already answers.
- Optional Laya ranking: `--dataset experience --kind question --task next-question` (which question next) and `--kind archetype|philosophy|style --task direction` (which direction fits).
- (Recommended) Run the discovery loop (`experience/DISCOVERY-LOOP.md`, phase A) before the three directions: idea deck of example sites with their structure, browsing round with the user, screenshots in `ai-frontend-output/ux/references/`, picks cited as `[ref: <slug>]` and recorded with `--ref "reference:<slug>"`.
- Write `ai-frontend-output/ux/EXPERIENCE-BRIEF.md` with three directions (safe/differentiated/experimental), the chosen one and the visual brief. **Gate:** no `02-UX-FLOWS` without it.
- Apply the anti-generic list and the purpose/convergence tests from `experience/STYLE-DIRECTIONS.md`.

## UX phase (proven flows)

Run `02-UX-FLOWS` with the bundled UX flow skills (`userflow` + 15 `flow-*`: auth, onboarding, checkout, paywall, settings, navigation, tables, forms, errors, empty states, AI chat…).

```bash
node ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/context.mjs   # → ai-frontend-output/ux/REPO-CONTEXT.md (incl. ux_present)
```

Then follow `ai-frontend-guide-kit/guides/02-UX-FLOWS.md`:

- No UX in the repo → design from scratch with `userflow` (load 1–4 flow skills, never from memory) → `UX-SPEC.md` + `flow-report.html` + `ux-map.excalidraw`.
- UX exists → **ask the user once**: Summarize (as-is + audit, no changes) or Radical redesign (baseline → ideal UX → diff). Never redesign silently; redesign is UX-only (`PRODUCT.md` stays).
- Single surface → `/userflow audit …` (findings only).

The visual screen map is part of the phase: use the sibling `ux-map` skill with the local Excalidraw MCP (`tools/excalidraw-mcp.mjs`). The template comes from the brief's `navigation_model` (`one-page`, `flow`, `hub`, `catalog`, `console`, `tree`), areas/colors from the brief IA, and the legend includes the direction (+ `P(fit)` when Laya ranked). Redesign snapshots `ux-map-baseline.excalidraw` first; the map is maintained incrementally, never regenerated blind. If the MCP is unavailable, use the skill's manual fallback and say so.

**BMAD / spec-driven repos:** `context.mjs` detects them (`Framework:` in `REPO-CONTEXT.md`). Read `ai-frontend-guide-kit/guides/ADAPTERS.md`: with a BMAD PRD use it as the business anchor (no duplicate `PRODUCT.md`) and cite stories with `--ref "story:<id>"`; with OpenSpec, specs are the behavioral source of truth and decisions cite `--ref "spec:<capability>"`.

The UI inventory and memory `--screen/--block` names come from `UX-SPEC.md`.

## Total polish (phase 3)

Before closing a screen, run the sibling skill `frontend-polish` when installed: external audits (`impeccable`, taste-skill, emilkowalski) if available, the Playwright MCP loop (states, console, accessibility, keyboard, reduced motion, responsive) and the closing `@playwright/test` regression of `09-VERIFY`. Fallback without tools: the distilled checklist of `08-PHILOSOPHY`.

## Query the catalog (do this before writing components)

```bash
node ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/find.mjs --category hero --stack react --commercial
node ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/find.mjs --text marquee --limit 8
node ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/get.mjs <entry-id>   # license, deps, install command
```

Rules:

- **Reuse → adapt → build.** Create custom only when nothing fits or the license blocks you.
- Licenses are facts: check `license_type` / `commercial_use` in `get` before using anything.
  Never use `non-commercial` entries in commercial work; verify `unknown` ones on their page.
- Before closing a selection, present 2–3 **combinations** with rationale and `get` facts; web-discovered components stay `provisional` until their license is verified (`experience/DISCOVERY-LOOP.md`, phase B).
- Keep high-impact animations to 1–2 per view and respect the brief's anti-generic list.

## Selection memory (`ai-frontend-output/`)

Keep a reusable history of decisions and combinations (the folder survives kit refreshes):

```bash
node ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/memory.mjs combo list     # check saved combinations BEFORE searching
node ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/memory.mjs add --screen <screen> --block <block> --need "..." \
  --decision reuse|adapt|build --id <entry-id> [--style a,b] [--notes "..."]
node ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/memory.mjs add --screen experience --block direction \
  --need "..." --decision adapt --ref "direction:<id>"
node ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/memory.mjs combo save <name> --note "..."   # snapshot for reuse
node ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/memory.mjs combo show <name>                # entries + install commands
node ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/memory.mjs combo apply <name>               # reuse in this project
```

Rules: check combinations before searching; record **every** decision right after choosing (facts come from the catalog); `ai-frontend-output/SUMMARY.md` is the generated styles/components summary.

## Laya (optional local ranking — consent once per session)

`laya_select.py` ranks questions, experience directions and components with calibrated probabilities, running entirely on this PC. **It is opt-in:** ask the user once per session/project, record `laya_consent` in `EXPERIENCE-BRIEF.md`, then use `--confirmed` per call. For components, `--direction <id>` passes the chosen direction into the ranking state so the fit matches the UX direction.

```bash
python ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/laya_select.py --check      # ready? (exit 0)
python ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/laya_select.py --need "…" --dry-run   # preview, no model
# after consent, pick the command matching the task:
python ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/laya_select.py --dataset experience --kind question \
  --task next-question --context-file ai-frontend-output/ux/EXPERIENCE-BRIEF.md --confirmed
python ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/laya_select.py --dataset experience --kind archetype \
  --task direction --context-file ai-frontend-output/ux/EXPERIENCE-BRIEF.md --confirmed
python ai-frontend-guide-kit/tools/laya_select.py --need "…" --category <category> --commercial \
  --direction <experience-id> --context-file ai-frontend-output/ux/EXPERIENCE-BRIEF.md --confirmed
```

Without consent the script exits with code 3 and does not load the model. If Python/Laya is unavailable, continue with the question tree, the heuristic tables and `find`/`get` — the workflow never depends on Laya. Laya scores semantic fit only; licenses and install commands always come from the catalog.

## Do not

- Do not read the whole catalog or the whole `experience-manifest.json` into context: use `find`/`get`, the index cards and dry-runs.
- Do not copy third-party component source into the kit.
- Do not strip license notices from copied components.
